Day 9 of my AI Journey – Building an AI-Based Farmer Query Support & Advisory System 🌱

Farmers often face urgent questions about crops, pests, weather, subsidies, and market prices. Unfortunately, timely expert advice is rarely accessible, and agricultural helplines are often overloaded.

To solve this, I explored building a “Digital Krishi Officer” – an AI-powered advisory system that:
✅ Understands farmer queries in natural language (voice/text, e.g., Malayalam or English)
✅ Supports image uploads for disease detection
✅ Uses AI + agri knowledge bases to provide accurate, context-aware answers instantly
✅ Personalizes responses based on crop, season, and location
✅ Escalates complex queries to local agri officers when needed
✅ Learns continuously from real farmer interactions and expert feedback

🌾 Impact:

Makes expert-level advice instantly accessible

Reduces the burden on agricultural officers

Bridges the gap between farmers and technology

Empowers farmers with knowledge on crop care, subsidies, and market trends

This project is close to my heart, as agriculture forms the backbone of our economy, and AI can play a huge role in supporting farmers.

🚀 Imagine every farmer having a 24/7 personal agricultural advisor in their pocket!
